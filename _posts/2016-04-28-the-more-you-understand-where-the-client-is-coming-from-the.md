description: 'The more you understand where the client is coming from, the higher your chance of making a sale. Wow, it just got me today as I was in a 3 hour meeting with a potential client that we have met twice before. The more you get close to the client, the closer the client gets to you! We have been asked to send a proposal again - this time for a different objective and there is no competing interests.'
