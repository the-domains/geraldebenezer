  In July & August 2016, I was involved as an assessor in a business simulation
  for a GLC. It was interesting to see how this GLC has evolved in a short
  period of time since Q4, 2015 to reach a stage where talent development is a
  priority. Although the business simulation mechanisms could be improved
  further, the good news is that the simulation has set the stage to trigger a
  level of entrepreneurial and leadership thinking that may not have been part
  of the organizational culture before.
