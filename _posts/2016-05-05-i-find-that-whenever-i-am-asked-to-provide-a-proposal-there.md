  I find that whenever I am asked to provide a proposal, there is one of two
  reasons. Either there is a business challenge that needs to be overcome or the
  company is doing really well and there are lots of opportunities in front of
  them and the team needs additional training to bring forward their skill-sets.
  Which one would it be for you?

Once we are clear on which one it is, then we can focus on next steps. What have you tried before - what has worked well and what has not worked as well. How do you best assimilate training to your teams?What are their preferred learning styles?
