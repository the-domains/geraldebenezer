What are the Top 3 qualities of a organizational consultant?

Flexibility to cater to the organizational needs. A one trick pony with one set of tools and approach may not be best suited to address your needs.

Relationship-centric. The focus is on the relationship with the client. 

Attentive. Resist temptation to put yourself in the client's story. Facilitate the journey of the client. Seek first to understand, then to be understood.
