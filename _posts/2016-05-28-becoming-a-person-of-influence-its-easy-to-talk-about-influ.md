description: "Becoming a person of influence. Its easy to talk about influence when you have the power to sanction or offer rewards. What happens if these well-accepted organizational \"tools\" were taken away from you. How would you lead in this situation? What other tools can you muster and administer in your role in the absence of these tools? In my view, the most effective person is one who uses the standard organizational tools as a last resort in any situation. What are the other tools that you have at your disposal then? In this article, I suggest some perspectives to consider. In this article, we talk about positive psychology. Positive psychology is an extremely powerful tool and is very appealing in many various organizational contexts - goal setting, delegating tasks, mid-year reviews, performance appraisals. A powerful way of thinking is to use the Golden circle approach popularized by Simon Sinek - the Why, How & What. Many a times managers default to the \"What\" - I want this to be done without talking about the Why and the How.\_"
