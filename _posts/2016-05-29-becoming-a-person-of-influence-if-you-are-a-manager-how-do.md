description: 'Becoming a person of influence. If you are a Manager, how do you communicate your mission and vision to your people. The ideal way is to ensure that the people had a say in the departmental objectives and plans at the outset. In the event that this was not the case, how do you build this ownership in a practical way? I suggest three steps : 1) Cast the vision 2) Help to establish the link between their personal goals and departmental objectives 2) Trust your people to rise to the challenge 3) Coach to excellence. It may seem like an oversimplication but this is all you need assuming that the people have the skills required to do the job. Among the four steps, which one would you say is the most challenging to do?'
