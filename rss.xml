            <description><![CDATA[<p>Becoming a person of influence. How do you apply the Golden Circle if you are Manager. Its to let your team know what you believe in within the overall context of the organizational mission and vision. In the unlikely case that the mission and vision is incongruent with what you believe in, then you are probably at a cross-road where a decision has to be made - stay on or leave amicably. How do you communicate what you believe in? There are a couple of factors to consider - what makes you inspiring? , what makes you unique?, what are your strengths?, what are your vulnerabilities?, what makes you human?, what makes you trustworthy?, what makes you a leader?, why should others believe in you? A practical way to do this is through story-telling.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[I am a fan of Dr Heidi Grant Halvorson research in motivation science. She talks of the prevalence of two mindsets - one is the " Be Good" mindset and the other "Get Better" mindset. Based on numerous experiments, research concludes that those with the "Get Better" mindset outperform the one with the "Be Good" mindset. The question is how do you cultivate the "Get Better" mindset?]]></title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I find that whenever I am asked to provide a proposal, there is one of two reasons. Either there is a business challenge that needs to be overcome or he company is doing really well and there are lots of opportunities in front of them and the team needs additional training to bring forward their skill-sets. Which one would it for you? </p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The more you understand where the client is coming from, the higher your chance of making a sale. Wow, it just got me today as I was in a 3 hour meeting with a potential client that we have met twice before. The more you get close to the client, the closer the client gets to you! We have been asked to send a proposal again - this time for a different objective and there is no competing interests.</p>]]></description>
